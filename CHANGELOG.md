=========================

- *(NEW)* Item Groups
  - You are now able to create groups and move items into them.
  - Group up raid related items, your character's profession material
    or other context of your choosing.
  - Every item group is specific to the character's item list while 
    it is still supported to track and view your other character's item
    lists, including seeing their groups.
  - Alternate existing groups by changing group names.
  - Collapse groups in the panel to focus on specific topics on what to farm.
